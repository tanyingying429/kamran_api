# Getting Started with Kamran Strapi Api
The back end api is written in <a href="https://strapi.io/"target="_blank">strapi</a>. (Node.js)
Note: if using a SQLite database, you have to install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/"target="_blank">Python</a>.
## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Note: node version should be 14.x.x.\
You can install the node version by using nvm.\
### `npm run develop`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:1338] to view it in your browser.

If you want to check the database, you should login to the admin panel.
The admin panel of Strapi runs at http://localhost:1338/admin
Here you can login with the following account infos(email: hantig1986@cnstytech.com    password: Admin12345!).

## Libraries Used and Why

Used sendgrid service for email testing.
Note: Since I created the free account, sometimes email transfer mayn't work and the sent email is stored to spam folder of the receiver. I hope you would understand this point.

## A screenshot/gif of what was made

## What you would do if you had more time

If I had more time, I would research how Round Robin selection could be constructed more rationally in UI and backend logic.
